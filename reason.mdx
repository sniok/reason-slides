## What is ReasonML

 - New syntax for **OCaml**
 - Compiles to JS
 - Looks like JS
 - Made by react team

---

## <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/ocaml/ocaml-card.png" height="150" />

 - ML family language (Standard ML)
 - Functional language ðŸŽ‰
 - Immutable by default ðŸŽ‰
 - Statically typed (with inference!)
 - Refined and polished for over 20 years
 - **The language** for react
 - *First react prototype was made in SML (similar to OCaml)*

ReasonML addresses the biggest problems
that Iâ€™ve observed in building UI applications
over the last five years.

```reason
let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

sum(2, 5);
```

---

## The best reason features

 - Types
 - Variant
 - Pattern matching

---

## Types

```reason
let a = 1;
let a: int = 1;
```

---

## Types

```reason
type circle = {
  radius: float
};

let pi = 3.14159;

let calculateArea = c => pi * c.radius * c.radius;
```

---

## Variant

```reason
type action = 
  | NextPage
  | PreviousPage
```
---

## Variant!
```reason
type action = 
  | NextPage
  | PreviousPage
  | SelectPage(int)
```

---

## Pattern matching

```reason
let numberAsWord = num =>
  switch(num) {
    | 1 => "one"
    | 2 => "two"
  }
```

---


## Exhaustive pattern matching

```reason
let numberAsWord = num =>
  switch(num) {
    | 1 => "one"
    | 2 => "two"
    ^^^
    You forgot to handle a possible value here, for example: 
    0
  }
```

---

```reason
let numberAsWord = num =>
  switch(num) {
    | 1 => "one"
    | 2 => "two"
    | _ => "whatever"
  }
```

---

## Pattern matching

```reason

let currentPage = 5;

let reducer = action => {
  switch(action) {
    | NextPage => currentPage + 1
    | PreviousPage => currentPage - 1
    | SelectPage(page) => page
  }
}
```

---

## Pattern matching

```reason

let currentPage = 5;

let reducer = 
  fun
  | NextPage => currentPage + 1
  | PreviousPage => currentPage - 1
  | SelectPage(page) => page

```

---

```reason

let state = 5;

type action = 
  | NextPage
  | PreviousPage
  | SelectPage(int)

let reducer = 
  fun
  | NextPage => state + 1
  | PreviousPage => state - 1
  | SelectPage(page) => page  

```

---

## JS Part 1
```js
let state = 5;

const NEXT_PAGE = 'NEXT_PAGE';
const PREVIOUS_PAGE = 'PREVIOUS_PAGE';
const SELECT_PAGE = 'SELECT_PAGE';

const nextPage = () => ({ type: NEXT_PAGE });
const previousPage = () => ({ type: PREVIOUS_PAGE });
const selectPage = page => ({ type: NEXT_PAGE, page: page });
```

---

## JS Part 2

```js
const reducer = action => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case NEXT_PAGE:
      return state + 1;
    case PREVIOUS_PAGE:
      return state - 1;
    case SELECT_PAGE:
      return action.page;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

## So much more ðŸ˜±

 - Tuples
 - Labeled arguments
 - Built-in currying
 - Pipeline operator
 - Option
 - Compiling to native
 - Modules
 - Functors
 - .rei files
 - Easy js interop
